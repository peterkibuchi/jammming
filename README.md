## General Information
- Jammming is powered by the Spotify API.
- I took on this project as a hands-on means of learning how to bring together knowledge of React components, passing state, requests and working with APIs to build a real world application.


## Technologies Used
- React


## Features
- Allows one to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, name it, and save it to their Spotify account.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_.


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Include preview samples for each track
- Add a loading screen while playlist is saving
- Update the access token logic to expire at exactly the right time, instead of setting expiration from when the user initiates their next search
- Ensure playlist information doesnâ€™t get cleared if a user has to refresh their access token

To do:
- Only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results
- After user redirect on login, restoring the search term from before the redirect
- Enable user to adjust the order of tracks in the playlist
